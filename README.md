# Coding Exercise

For this exercise, please complete the implementation of the `Dish`
class and `choose_best_dish_for_dinner` function. Stubs of both are
provided in `dishes.py`, and additional instructions are included in
comments in that file.

There are unit tests in `test_dishes.py`. Several tests have already been
provided and we would like you to add more to cover the various
scenarios listed in the `choose_best_dish_for_dinner` comments, as well as
any additional tests you feel are necessary or helpful. You can run the
tests by executing `python test_dishes.py` from this directory.

The aim of this exercise is to see the quality of code you would consider
"production ready", like what you would submit for a code review by your
peers.

Notes:

* Don't worry about validating function or constructor inputs - assume all
  parameters will be passed in correctly
* You can use any standard Python libraries but please do not add any third
  party dependencies
* You can use Python 2 or 3, please mention which you used when returning
  your solution
* You can refactor the `Dish` class and add additional functions or
  function parameters as you like

Please take as long as you need to complete the exercise. In most cases it
should take about 45 minutes.

If you have any questions or if any of the instructions are not clear please
let me know.
